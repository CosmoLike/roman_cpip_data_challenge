# Data challenge for 3x2pt
The main goals of this first data challenge are:
- Train everyone on using Cocoa with their local resources 
- Study “User variance” in obtaining results and interpreting outcome (e.g. differences in samplers/plotting routines/smoothing)
- Study differences in more complex data vector scenarios (systematics)
- Publish paper documenting the challenge and exploring the impact of systematics on Roman baseline constraints 






## Each Directory Contains:
- Covariance matrix
- Redshift distribution
- Data vector
- Additional information on specific scenario

## General details:
- Data challenge 1 uses a LCDM cosmology
- Lens = source. We use the same redshift distriutions and photo-z uncertainties for both samples.
