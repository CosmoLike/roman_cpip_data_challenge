# Data challenge for 3x2pt
The main goals of this first data challenge are:
- Train everyone on using Cocoa with their local resources 
- Study “User variance” in obtaining results and interpreting outcome (e.g. differences in samplers/plotting routines/smoothing)
- Study differences in more complex data vector scenarios (systematics)
- Publish paper documenting the challenge and exploring the impact of systematics on Roman baseline constraints 


## Instructions:
- Download the latest version of cocoa
- Use the Roman_real and Roman_fourier project repositories for your analysis
- Use the data vectors, covariances, redshift information that are in the "data_challenge1_fourier_medium" and "data_challenge1_real_medium" respectively
- Enter your results into a table similar to the file "YOURTEAMNAME_results.tex"
- Submit your results via email to timeifler_at_arizona.edu


## Each Directory Contains:
- Covariance matrix
- Redshift distribution
- Data vector
- Additional information on specific scenario

## General details:
- Data challenge 1 uses a LCDM cosmology
- Lens = source. We use the same redshift distriutions and photo-z uncertainties for both samples.
